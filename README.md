# Haskell Stellar SDK

This package provides functions for interacting with Horizon servers that are
used as part of the Stellar payment network. There is support for performing
queries to a Horizon server, as well as for constructing, signing and submitting
transactions to the network.

## Attribution

The code to parse XDR specifications and generate the corresponding code was
taken from [dylex/haskell-nfs](https://github.com/dylex/haskell-nfs/tree/master/rpc).

## Build

```
haskell-stellar-sdk/library/Network/Stellar$ hsrpcgen Stellar-transaction.x -o TransactionXdr.hs -m Network.Stellar.TransactionXdr
```
